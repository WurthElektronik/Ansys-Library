## Introduction
Ansys was founded in 1970 to automate finite element analysis (FEA), which was previously performed by hand. They have developed a software suite which today includes mechanical, structural, CAD, fluid, material and electromagnetic simulations.  

[Würth Elektronik](https://www.we-online.com/) has a growing portfolio of models available for use in Ansys HFSS (High Frequency Simulation Software) or Ansys Icepak (thermal simulation). These models allow Ansys users to accurately simulate, troubleshoot and solve RF, EMI or thermal issues before going to production.  
Our models are created to provide the best possible simulation results. They feature:
* Detailed and accurate material parameters for accurate simulation
* Highly detailed and precise 3D models
* Model creation process verified against known laboratory results
* Mesh optimized for balance of simulation speed and accuracy

For how to use models in GitHub repository, you can refer to the help document in this folder.
