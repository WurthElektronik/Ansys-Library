**Ansys Library for Würth Elektronik Products**
=
## Introduction
Ansys was founded in 1970 to automate finite element analysis (FEA), which was previously performed by hand. They have developed a software suite which today includes mechanical, structural, CAD, fluid, material and electromagnetic simulations.  

[Würth Elektronik](https://www.we-online.com/) has a growing portfolio of models available for use in Ansys HFSS (High Frequency Simulation Software) or Ansys Icepak (thermal simulation). These models allow Ansys users to accurately simulate, troubleshoot and solve RF, EMI or thermal issues before going to production.  
Our models are created to provide the best possible simulation results. They feature:
* Detailed and accurate material parameters for accurate simulation
* Highly detailed and precise 3D models
* Model creation process verified against known laboratory results
* Mesh optimized for balance of simulation speed and accuracy

For how to use models in GitHub repository, you can refer to the help document in this folder. If you have any advice or questions, please send email to libraries@we-online.com or Melon.Huang@we-online.com to let us know.

**Please read Disclaimer carefully before downloading and using Würth Elektronik Models.**

**Note1: Ansys library and xml file in GitHub repository are always the latest.**

**Note2: Ansys has a big update in 2023R1 and some geometry core feature changes so models are not compatible before and after 2023R1. That's why we have two folders of different version for some series, but mostly we only have 2023R1 available. If you need higher or lower version model, please send email to libraries@we-online.com or Melon.Huang@we-online.com.**
